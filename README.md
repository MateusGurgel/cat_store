# Cat Store

A very simple front-end that consumes a cat image API to generate cats for sale. The project was developed as an example of how to work with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stack and was used to teach students the principles of web development in the classroom.
## Running locally

### Clone the project

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MateusGurgel/cat_store
```

### Access the project directory

Navigate to the project directory with the command:

```bash
cd cat_store
```

### 

**Running the Main File:**

To run the main file, you can use any HTTP server. However, I suggest using the Live Server extension for VS Code for a simpler and more efficient experience.

Steps:
1. Install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Right-click on the `index.html` file (or the main file) and select "Open with Live Server".

####

This will automatically launch the project in your default web browser. üòÅ
